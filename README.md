# LoanComparison
A program that allows a user to input a loan amount, length of loan term in years, and starting &amp; ending loan interest rates.  It then calculates and displays the rates incremented by an 1/8 point and the corresponding monthly payment and total payment.

The program was originally an exercise from pg. 197 of my textbook <i>Introduction to Java: Programming and Data Structures</i> 11th Edition, by Y. Daniel Liang. I expanded upon the intial design by allowing the user to designate the range of interest rates rather than fixed at 5 and 8%, along with various user input validations.
